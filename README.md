## The classic NES game Krazy Kreatures, reimagined.

Krazy Kreatures is a puzzle game published in 1990 for the NES, which I ended up playing by chance, just because I thought the cover looked cool.

Not only was the cover cool, but so was the game! I can't remember the last time I was so hooked on an arcade game, a simple idea, perfectly executed.

I was surprised to discover how unknown this game was, most likely because it wasn't officially licensed and probably didn't reach the wider public. Coincidentally, at the same time I discovered the game, I was learning to program games using C/C++ and Raylib.

And so this little project came about, I'm not just talking about a more up-to-date reimplementation of the game, but a reimagining with new ideas.
